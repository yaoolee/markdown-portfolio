## About me
Hi, I'm Yao Tiem Lee, a passionate and ambitious student currently pursuing a postgraduate in Web Development at Humber College. I'm quite eager to learn and apply my skills in front-end and back-end development to create user-friendly web applications. I'm particularly interested in React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js. I'm actively seeking internships and opportunities to contribute to real-world projects.
